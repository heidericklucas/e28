## Notes for instructor
I accidentally put on my calendar that the due date for P2 was November 24. So today, November 25, would be one day late, therefore I would be losing 5 points for being late. However, I noticed today that the due date was actually November 17, and therefore I would not be able to submit my project after the 24th. My P2 is done, as you can see, and I'm really sorry for this stupid mistake. If you can accept it and take 10 points off my final grade for this project, I will be very thankful. Thanks, Susan.
